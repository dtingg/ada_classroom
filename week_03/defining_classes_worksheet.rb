# Ada - Week 03
# Defining Classes Worksheet

# Superhero
# Define a class that represents the state and behavior of a superhero, named Superhero by following these steps.

# Celsius
# Define a class that represents the state and behavior of the temperature unit Celsius, named Celsius.
# Every instance of Celsius should be instantiated with temperature. What syntax do we use to define that? def initialize(temperature)
# Every instance of Celsius should keep track of its own temperature. What syntax do we use to define that, and assign it to the temperature we passed in? @temperature = temperature
# Every instance of Celsius has the behavior of returning its temperature as Fahrenheit. What syntax do we use to define behavior? def fahrenheit

# Optional: CoffeeOrder
# Define a class called CoffeeOrder that has a lot of parameters. Maintain the practice of using main.rb to catch your syntax errors and practice making and using instances of classes.

# Optional: ProfessionalYeller
# Prove to yourself that values of instance variables can be modified within an instance of a class, but instance variables between different instances do not interact.
# Does a ProfessionalYeller take in any arguments whenever a new instance is made? - favorite_phrase
# What does a ProfessionalYeller keep track of as pieces of state (as instance variables)? - phrase, count
# What does the behavior (instance method) yell do? - It returns the phrase count number of times and increases count by 1.
# What should we see in the Terminal when we run main.rb?
