Dianna Tingg (she/her) is currently studying full-stack software engineering at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. Ada is a highly selective training program for women and gender diverse people who want to become software developers. The rigorous curriculum includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, as well as computer science fundamentals, test-driven development, pair programming, leadership principles, and social justice.

Before coming to Ada, Dianna was working as a Quality Program Manager for Swedish Medical Center.  She specialized in Medicare regulations regarding the use of electronic medical record software. After spending many hours trying to "debug" certain reports that kept failing, she finally decided to increase her technical knowledge and pursue a long-time interest in computer programming. She began her coding journey by using free online tutorials on Codecademy and Udacity and she also completed several Python classes through the University of Washington's Professional and Continuing Education program.
